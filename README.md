# Verification-of-Asynchronous-Fifo-using-System-Verilog

The Asynchronous FIFO (First-In-First-Out) is a commonly used design component for safe data transfer between two different clock domains. It uses separate read and write clocks and typically implements Gray code pointer synchronization to avoid metastability issues. This project focuses on verifying an asynchronous FIFO design that supports independent write and read operations, along with status signals such as full, empty, overflow, and underflow. Proper verification of asynchronous FIFOs is critical to ensure reliable cross-clock domain communication in SoCs and high-speed digital systems.

The verification environment was developed using SystemVerilog with a modular and reusable architecture including generator, driver, monitor, reference model, and scoreboard components. Directed and randomized test cases were implemented to validate pointer synchronization, data integrity, boundary conditions (full/empty), and error scenarios. Assertions and functional coverage were incorporated to check protocol correctness and ensure thorough verification. The testbench confirms correct data ordering, accurate flag generation, and robust operation across asynchronous clock domains.
